Functional images quality assurance included measures of in-scanner motion (framewise displacement) and normalization quality (correlation of functional image to template image). fMRI runs with a median FD less than or equal to 0.2 and normalized cross correlation greater than or equal to 0.8 were considered of adequate quality. We provide FD, normalization quality, and many other quality metrics for all scans.
